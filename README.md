### Hello there!! ðŸ‘‹

I am a passionate Data Science and AI enthusiast who finds joy in exploring new ideas and discovering innovative solutions. With a curious mind and a desire to learn, I constantly seek out-of-the-ðŸ“¦ approaches to challenges. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m actively engaged in developing an image-to-image translation model specifically for medical images. This project involves using advanced technology to enhance the accuracy and precision of image translations, which can have a significant impact on improving medical diagnoses and treatments.
